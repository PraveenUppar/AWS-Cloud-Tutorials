AWS VPC (Virtual Private CLoud) -- Isolates our network resources

Two users --> Two instance --> Same physical host --> Same Zone --> Same Region
Both the instance are protected by each other by VPC

With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined

Without VPC adn subnet we cannot launch EC2    
we can add upto 5 CIDR RANGE WITHIN SINGLE VPC

A VPC can have more than 1 IP address range which is used to connect diff subnets

In one zone we can only create only one subnet so to create multiple subnets in diff zones we need to create 
multiple IP address range in the VPC 

Step 1: Create a VPC 
A default VPC  is always assigned when created an account
We can create a custom VPC in AWS

Step 2: Create a subnet

What is subnet ? --> Region --> VPC --> Zones --> Subnets
A subnet can only use only one Zone create a diff subnet in diff zones 

Step 3: Internet Gateway

What is internet gateway --> Region --> VPC --> Zones --> Subnets --> Internet Gateway
Internet Gateway is always attached to the VPC not the subnets 
Inbound and outbound is only allowed for those instances which have public IP
Internet bandwidth --> Unlimited

Step 4: Route Table Entry

What is route table entry --> --> Region --> VPC --> Zones --> Subnets --> Internet Gateway --> Route Table
It connects the subnets inside VPC and connects to the Internet Gateway

VPC two-tier architecture

Region --> VPC --> 2 Zones --> 2 Subnets in diff zones --> 1 private subnet for database and 1 public subnet for web server 

For database no inbound and it is set as private subnet

** ONLY PUBLIC IP WILL CONNECT TO INTERNET GATEWAY

VPC Instance Endpoint

In the two tier architecture we have a region --> VPC --> two zones --> and in each zone we have private and public subnet 
in private subnet we have our ec2 and in public subnet we have our another ec2

The one in the public subnet has both pubic and private IP so we can access from internet as it is connected to internet gateway through route table for public IP
But for the private subnet we have only private IP and no internet connection has it is not connected to internet gateway but only connected to main route table 
(we cant connect to through private IP bcz it is not connected to internet gateway)

Method 1:
HOW WE ACCESS THE EC2 FROM PRIVATE SUBNET --> Creating VPC ENDPOINTS

Method 2: 
Now we created a instance endpoint we can access the private subnet ec2 from the public subnet ec2
(IT IS CALLED AS BASTION HOST)

THOUGH WE CONNECTED THE PROBLEM IN PRIVATE SUBNET EC2 WE CANNOT DOWNLOAD ANY ANYTHING (OS,DATA,SECURITY,DEPENDEIES) BCZ NO INTERNET

AWS VPC NAT GATEWAY -- It connects the internet to private subnet ec2 from the internet gateway through the public subnet ec2

** ONLY OUTBOUND INTERNET NO INBOUND INTERNET
A public ip is assigned to the NAT GATEWAY --> Table Router --> Internet Gateway
A NAT gateway is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. 
You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.

***we create a NAT gateway in the pubic subnet not in private subnet

VPC PEERING --> Allow us to COMMUNICATe with VPCs form same region and diff region

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCo1zmh8hBU&list=PLIm9KY-ideOsCuwMRoX1ltMZGuNZeBrRp&index=65

** IN A REGION WE CAN MAX MAKE up to 5 VPC
** IN A REGION TWO VPC CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER BY DEFAULT

ONCE WE ARE CONNECTED WITH TWO VPC AND THE STATUS IS ACTIVE BUT THE COMMUNICATION IS NOT YET ACTIVATED BCZ AFTER PEERING CONNECTION WE HAVE TO DO A ROUTE TABLE ENTRY
ROUTE TABLE ENTRY SHOULD BE DONE FOR BOTH THE VPC

----------   AWS NOTES  -----------

Virtual private clouds (VPC)
A VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in
your own data center. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets.

Subnets
A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. A subnet must reside in a single Availability
Zone. After you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.

IP addressing
You can assign IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6, to your VPCs and subnets. You can also bring
your public IPv4 addresses and IPv6 GUA addresses to AWS and allocate them to resources in
your VPC, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers.

Routing
Use route tables to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Gateways and endpoints
A gateway connects your VPC to another network. For example, use an internet gateway to
connect your VPC to the internet. Use a VPC endpoint to connect to AWS services privately,
without the use of an internet gateway or NAT device.

Peering connections
Use a VPC peering connection to route traffic between the resources in two VPCs.

Traffic Mirroring
Copy network traffic from network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances
for deep packet inspection.

Transit gateways
Use a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub, to route traffic between your VPCs, VPN
connections, and AWS Direct Connect connections.

VPC Flow Logs
A flow log captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in
your VPC.

VPN connections
Connect your VPCs to your on-premises networks using AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS
VPN)
