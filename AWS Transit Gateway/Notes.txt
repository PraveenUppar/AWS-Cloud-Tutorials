AWS Transit Gateway

It solves the VPC Peering for large number of VPC

AWS Transit Gateway connects your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks through a central hub. This connection simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. 
Transit Gateway acts as a highly scalable cloud routerâ€”each new connection is made only once.

AWS Transit Gateway helps you design and implement networks at scale by acting as a cloud router. As your network grows, the complexity of managing incremental connections can slow you down. 
AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub.

AWS Transit Gateway provides a hub and spoke design for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks as a fully managed service without requiring you to provision third-party virtual appliances. 
No VPN overlay is required, and AWS manages high availability and scalability.

Transit Gateway enables customers to connect thousands of VPCs. You can attach all your hybrid connectivity (VPN and Direct Connect connections) to a single gateway, consolidating and controlling your organization's entire 
AWS routing configuration in one place (refer to the following figure).
